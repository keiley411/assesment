                        course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly therafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
                        - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,I've successfully switched
                        careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp,I've never written a line of code.I needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouranged to enroll by a
                    former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire cirriculum
                    and staff did not dissapoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                    The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
                    way theat no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
                    example of my development experience. It certainly hepled me land a job as a full-stack developer
                    after receiving multile offers. 100% recommended!"</p>
